# Claude Code Session Summary: Critical Path Game Development

## Overview
This session involved extensive development of "Critical Path," a turn-based AI strategy game where players act as CEOs of AI companies navigating the race to AGI while balancing safety concerns. The game evolved significantly from initial concept to a fully-featured dark-themed strategy experience.

## Major System Implementations

### Event System Architecture
- **Modular Event Framework**: Created `events.js` and `events.json` for extensible event management
- **Weighted Random Selection**: Implemented probability-based event generation with customizable weights
- **Multi-stage Dialogues**: Events now support initial text → player choice → result text → turn advancement
- **Event Counter System**: Tracks events seen and choices taken for requirement checking
- **Requirements System**: Events only appear when prerequisites are met (e.g., Nuclear Weapons requires robotics breakthrough)

### Complete DSA (Decisive Strategic Advantage) Track
Implemented the full progression path for corporate-to-nation-state transformation:
1. **Overseas Datacenter** (UAE/Russia/Malaysia variants) - Provides +1 AI level per turn
2. **Nuclear Weapons** (requires robotics) - Unlocks true independence from regulation  
3. **UN Recognition** (requires datacenter + nuclear weapons + resources ≥6) - 1.5x resource multiplier
4. **Missile Defense** (requires UN recognition) - Protection from state-level threats
5. **Decisive Strategic Advantage** (requires missile defense) - Immediate singularity victory

### Sanctions and Economic Systems
- **Sanctions Mechanics**: 100% probability sanctions event when sanctions are active, halves resources
- **Resource Calculation**: Dynamic formula incorporating UN recognition multipliers and sanctions penalties
- **Income Bonus System**: Product breakthroughs provide permanent +$1B per turn revenue streams
- **Cost Validation**: Event choices validate resource costs before execution

### User Interface Overhaul
- **Dark Theme Implementation**: Complete visual redesign with professional dark color scheme
- **Status Bar Formatting**: Color-coded indicators (red for danger, amber for warnings, green for positive effects)
- **Smart Button States**: Event action buttons grey out when unaffordable instead of showing popup errors
- **Resource Allocation Buttons**: Converted from radio buttons to action buttons with immediate resource application

## Game Design Improvements

### Narrative and Flow
- **Streamlined Headings**: Removed redundant "Turn X" formatting, simplified to "July 2026"
- **Better Game Setup**: Enhanced second-screen description explaining the CEO's strategic dilemma
- **Event Integration**: Events flow naturally after resource allocation without separate panels

### Resource Management
- **Immediate Application**: Resources apply when allocation button is clicked, not at end of turn
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of sanctions impact ("5 resources (10 resources x 50% sanctions factor)")
- **Button State Management**: Selected allocation button highlighted, others greyed out until next turn

### Strategic Depth
- **Product Breakthroughs**: Medicine and robotics events providing ongoing economic benefits
- **Geopolitical Realism**: Datacenter locations reflect real-world AI infrastructure considerations
- **Risk Escalation**: "Rogue AI Risk" label becomes red and bold at >75% for critical warnings

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
- **Modular Functions**: Separated concerns with dedicated functions for resource calculation, event generation, and UI updates
- **State Management**: Clean game state reset functionality and proper turn advancement logic
- **Error Prevention**: Eliminated popup dialogs in favor of disabled button states

### Event JSON Structure
```json
{
  "type": "event-name",
  "weight": 4,
  "requires": ["prerequisite-events"],
  "oneTime": true,
  "text_versions": ["Multiple narrative variants..."],
  "choices": [
    {
      "text": "Action description (-cost, +benefit)",
      "action": "accept",
      "cost": {"productPoints": 4, "money": 2},
      "benefit": {"incomeBonus": 1},
      "result_text": "Consequence narrative..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### UI Component System
- **Dynamic Action Labels**: Buttons show actual resource numbers ("AI R&D (+3 AI Level, +3 Risk)")
- **Conditional Styling**: Status bar elements change color based on game state
- **Responsive Button States**: Event actions enable/disable based on affordability and allocation status

## Quality of Life Features

### Visual Polish
- **Consistent Typography**: Monospace font throughout with proper bold formatting
- **Color Psychology**: Red for danger/depletion, amber for moderate warnings, green for positive effects
- **Clean Event Display**: Removed yellow panels in favor of integrated dark theme styling

### User Experience
- **No Popup Interruptions**: All resource validation through visual button states
- **Clear Progression**: Turn advancement only possible after resource allocation
- **Immediate Feedback**: Status bar updates instantly when resources change

## Game Balance and Mechanics

### Resource Economics
- **Corporate Resources**: Expire each turn unless used, separate from saved money
- **Sanctions Impact**: Meaningful economic penalties requiring strategic response
- **Income Diversification**: Product breakthroughs provide alternative revenue streams

### Strategic Choices
- **Risk vs. Reward**: DSA track offers power at the cost of increased doom and sanctions risk
- **Resource Allocation**: Five distinct paths (AI R&D, Diplomacy, Product, Safety R&D, Revenue) with clear tradeoffs
- **Event Responses**: Meaningful choices with lasting consequences tracked throughout the game

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### String Replacement Issues
- **Root Cause**: File modifications during development caused exact string matches to fail
- **Solution**: Targeted, incremental changes using smaller string sections and systematic approach

### Button State Synchronization
- **Problem**: Visual selection not matching actual game state after event handling
- **Resolution**: Proper selection clearing timing and default fallback logic

### Event Flow Logic
- **Challenge**: Balancing immediate resource application with turn-based event resolution
- **Implementation**: Two-phase system (allocation → events → turn advancement)

## Final Architecture
The game now operates as a sophisticated turn-based strategy experience with:
- **Turn Structure**: Resource allocation → Event presentation → Player choice → Result display → Turn advancement
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Dark theme with color-coded status indicators and contextual button states
- **Strategic Depth**: Multiple victory paths through different event chains and resource management approaches
- **Extensibility**: JSON-driven event system allowing easy addition of new content

The codebase is well-organized with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and a polished user interface that provides immediate feedback for all player actions.
