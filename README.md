# Critical Path

A WIP game to represent the AI singularity.

## To run

Open `index.html` in a browser, e.g. by using Cursor Live Preview or `python -m http.server 8000`.

The deployed version should also be on Github Pages, at `tkwa.github.io/save-the-world-game`

---

## Game design

### Goals

* Communicate about a potential AI future
* The primary goal is to save the world
* The player is someone with agency, like a company CEO

Important dynamics to model (rough priority order)

* Existential stakes
* Unexpected speed of the AI future
* Tradeoffs between capability and safety
* The potential for coordination to reduce risk
* Power of future AI companies over society

Possibly:

* Be engaging enough to go viral

### Addressing core goals

#### Existential stakes

* Global conquest plot
* Rogue AI takeover plot
* Fear of rogue AI is naturally written into the game

#### Unexpected speed

* Exponential or superexponential growth
* Singularity happens in a surprisingly early calendar year
* The speed of AI development

#### Tradeoffs between capability and safety

* Finite resource allocation
* Events?

#### Coordination to reduce risk

* International treaty plot

#### Power of future AI companies

* Running for President
* Erosion of human agency
  * AI writes legislation, their AIs summarize it and recommend votes
* AI monopolizes all essential services-- therapist, medical etc.
* 80%+ unemployment, everyone else survives on welfare or UBI

####

## Notes

* Maybe the game could start in 2011 with quiet exponential growth and progress *through* 2025
* In a superexponential world, there must be a mechanism to reduce turn time
* To give a feeling of realism, could use actual names of politicians, make the player's role more prominent

### Things to model

Tier 1

* AI takeover risk
* Coordination
* International

Tier 2

* Superpersuasion
* Military drones
* Splitting the galaxies
