## [v0.5.0] - 2025-07-02

### Major Features
- **Enhanced Intro Sequence**: Complete redesign with step-based text system, dynamic AI level display, and progressive narrative flow from 3.3x to ~10x AI capability
- **Technology Visibility Controls**: Implemented mainGameStarted flag system to hide all technologies except robotaxi during intro, revealing full tech tree only when main game begins
- **Flexible Text Display System**: Replaced linear text array with dictionary-based system allowing mixed timing (some texts every 2 clicks, intellectual tasks every click)

### Intro Sequence Improvements
- **Dynamic AI Level**: Button shows actual increase value (+0.XX) and AI level displays with "x" suffix matching main game
- **Compound Growth**: AI R&D increases by 3% of current level instead of flat amount, creating realistic exponential progression
- **Progressive Narrative**: 6 intellectual tasks (poetry, scientific reasoning, mathematical proofs, creative writing, strategic planning, persuasive communication) appear rapidly to show accelerating AI progress
- **Smart Text Flow**: Line breaks only appear where paragraph breaks should naturally occur, maintaining sentence continuity
- **Risk Progression**: Rogue AI Risk fades in at step 19 and progresses from 9% to 20% over remaining clicks

### Technical Improvements
- **Step-Based Architecture**: Text system uses step numbers as keys for maximum flexibility in timing and content
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced excessive DOM manipulation with statusBarSetup flag to prevent repeated calls
- **Permanent Button States**: Added permanentlyDisabled flag to prevent button re-enabling after intro completion
- **Dynamic Content Updates**: AI level value updates in real-time within displayed text using regex replacement

### User Experience
- **Natural Flow**: Removed awkward line breaks between "board games" and intellectual capabilities list
- **Visual Consistency**: Intro status bar matches main game layout with proper 4-column structure
- **HTML Rendering**: Supports bold text and line breaks within text content for enhanced presentation

## [v0.4.0] - 2025-07-01

### Major Features
- **Interpretability Project System**: Complete implementation of labor-hour based interpretability research requiring 1B hours for 100% completion
- **Dynamic Project Unlocking**: Two-stage project unlock system with interpretability at 80 safety points and alignment at 320 safety points
- **Variable Project Display**: Projects section now shows different buttons based on unlock status rather than fixed layout
- **Enhanced Risk Calculations**: Interpretability reduces risk by factor of 1 + (progress / 100) in denominator alongside safety and alignment

### Project Mechanics
- **Progressive Unlock**: Interpretability unlocks first (80 safety), followed by alignment (320 safety) 
- **Labor-Hour Allocation**: Interpretability uses sqrt(hours/1000)*100 formula for realistic diminishing returns
- **Button Behavior**: Project buttons grey out other allocations when selected, max progress buttons disabled at 100%
- **Cost Structure**: All projects cost same as Safety R&D using Math.sqrt(playerAILevel)/2 formula

### User Interface
- **Tooltip Integration**: Updated risk tooltips to show all three factors (safety, alignment, interpretability) in calculation
- **Concise Labeling**: Interpretability button uses "Interp ðŸ”¬" for space efficiency
- **Selection State**: Project buttons properly integrate with allocation system showing selection status

### Event System
- **Restructured Events**: Modified safety-research-limitations event to unlock interpretability research first
- **New Alignment Event**: Created alignment-research-breakthrough event at 320 safety with compelling narrative
- **Event Conditions**: Added proper safety point thresholds for both interpretability (80) and alignment (320) events

### Technical Improvements
- **State Management**: Added interpretabilityProgress, interpretabilityLaborHours, and alignmentUnlocked to game state
- **Code Documentation**: Comprehensive project system guide added to CLAUDE.md for future development
- **Function Updates**: Extended getRiskFactors() and calculateAdjustedRiskPercent() to handle interpretability

## [v0.3.5] - 2025-07-01

### Major Refactoring
- **New utils.js Module**: Created centralized utility file containing all shared functions, constants, and game state factory
- **DRY Principle Implementation**: Eliminated code duplication by moving shared functions to single source of truth
- **Risk Calculation Consolidation**: Fixed inconsistent risk calculation formulas that were causing negative riskReduction values

### Technical Improvements
- **Script Loading Order**: Updated HTML to load utils.js first, ensuring proper dependency resolution
- **Cross-File Function Access**: Implemented proper global exports for browser environment and Node.js testing
- **ESLint Compliance**: Fixed all ESLint errors with proper global declarations and unused variable handling
- **Mathematical Consistency**: All risk calculations now use centralized getRiskFactors() function from utils.js

### Functions Moved to utils.js
- `GAME_CONSTANTS`, `INITIAL_TECHNOLOGIES`, `COMPANIES` array
- `createInitialGameState()` factory function
- `calculateAdjustedRiskPercent()`, `getRiskFactors()`, `getAISystemVersion()`
- `getRiskColor()`, `getGalaxyMultipliers()`

### Bug Fixes
